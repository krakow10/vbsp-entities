VBSP Entities
=============

## Game-Specific Entities (Generated)

This repo hosts the code generated by [vbsp-entities-codegen](https://github.com/krakow10/vbsp-entities-codegen).
Intended for use with the [vbsp crate](https://crates.io/crates/vbsp).

The entities have different fields depending on which game created the bsp file, so each game has its own implementation.  See the individual crates' README.md for an example.
